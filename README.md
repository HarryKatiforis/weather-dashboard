# weather-dashboard
## user story
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

### Project description
The aim of this project was the create a weather dashboard that displayed the 5-day forecast of a city when searched for, including the temperature windspeed and humidity percentage.

### Improvements to be made
In its current form, the user is able to searh for a city and have the temperature wind speed and humdity displayed in text, in the next update i wish to include anicon representing the weather of the city, as well as a 5 day forecast rather than just the one day.
